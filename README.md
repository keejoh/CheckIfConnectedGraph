# CheckIfConnectedGraph
Data Structures Proj 3: Check to see if a graph is connected given the graph as a txt file. 
Program takes either the graph files provided in the program folder 
(described in the subsequent running of the program) or a graph file (with the indicated format) 
that can be added to the program folder and runs the program to check whether or not the graph is connected.
The program uses a map to map vertices to corresponding edges. 
The program then validates whether or not all vertices can be reached from an initial starting point. 
This program operates as desired.
